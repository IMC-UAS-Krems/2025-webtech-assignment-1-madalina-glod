                    Hi! My name is Mădălina and I'm an 18yo student from Moldova, now living in Krems, Austria
                    and studying Informatics at IMC Krems University of Applied Sciences. Outside of studying,
                    I love spending my time doing things that I enjoy most. A big hobby of mine is traveling.
                    I love exploring and discovering new places, my last trip being to München, Germany.
                </p>

                    Hanging out with friends, watching movies, or just having relaxed evenings are some of my favourite
                    things to do. My friends are a big part of my life, and I always enjoy creating new memories with
                    them. The girls in the picture are my two
                    bestfriends, Alexa and Cristina, who I've known for many years. In the second picture Cristina and I
                    went to karting outside a mall, letting her drive
                    since she's the more adventurous type.

                    I come from Chișinău, Moldova — a small country with a big heart and rich traditions. No matter
                    where I end up,
                    Moldova will always have a special place in my heart. My favorite place to visit there is definitely
                    the city
                    center, where green parks, cozy cafés, and busy streets blend together.

                    In my free time I love cooking and baking, especially with my boyfriend. Some of the foods we make
                    often are chicken noodles and pancakes.
                    Even through in the picture it doesn't look very appetizing, we also tried mango sticky rice that
                    turned out suprisingly good!
